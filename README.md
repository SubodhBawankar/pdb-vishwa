# Power Distribution Board for Vishwa Rover 2024

The circuitry converts voltage from batteries to a specific voltage using voltage regulators and switching regulators. Adjustable voltage converters are used to convert 12V to 5V, 3.7V, and 3.3V. Switching buck-boost converters are used to obtain 7V, 9V, and 24V from 12V. All this circuitry is integrated into a single Printed Circuit Board.
